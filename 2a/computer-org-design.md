Moore's law

Use abstraction to simplify design

Make the common case fast

performance via parallelism

performance via pipelining

performance via prediction

hierarchy of memories: fastest, smallest, most expensive memory at top of hierarchy and slowest, largest, cheapest per bit on thje bottom. Caches give illusion that main memory is almost as fast as top and big and cheap as the bottom.

Dependability via redundancy: computer must not only be fast, they must be dependable. Since physical devices can fail, we make dependable systems by introducing redundant components.


Most important computer functions: handling basic input/output, allocating storage and memory, providing for protected sharing of computer resources among multiple applications using it simultaneously.

Assembler translates symbolic instructions into binary.
