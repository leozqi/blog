> Primary causes are unknown to us; but are subject to simple and constant laws, which may be discovered by observation, the study of them being the object of natural philosophy.

Fourier's work intends to lay down the mathematical laws that heat obeys.
He states in his _Theory of Heat_ that heat, not obeying the laws of mechanics, needed its own set of equations which he determined through careful observation.
He focuses on the science of discerning the most elementary properties influencing a problem before applying these to a more complex result.

His three main observations of variables when it comes to heat are:

1. The power to contain heat
2. To receive or transmit heat across their surfaces
3. To conduct heat through their interiors

It is notable that his chapter, "Preliminary Disclosure," goes over as much of the effects of heat on climate and the world as his findings.

> Profoound study of nature is the most fertile source of mathematical discoveries.

The analytical equations, extend to all general phenomena. There cannot be a language more universal and more simple, more free from errors and from obscurities, that is to say more worthy to express the invariable relations of natural things.

## Fourier on mathematical analysis

> ... mathematical analysis is as extensive as nature itself; it defines all perceptible relations ... Its chief attribute is clearness; it has no marks to express confused notions. It brings together phenomena most diverse, and discovers the hidden analogies which unite them.

## Theory of heat

When heat is unequally distributed in a solid mass, it tends to attain equilibrium.
The tendency to uniform distribution and the spontaneous emission which acts at the surface of bodies, change continually the temperature at their different points.
The problem of the propagation of heat consists in determining what is the temperature at each point of a body at a given instant, supposing that initial temperatures are known.

- If we expose a metallic ring to continued uniform heat, after a certain period of time, every point of the ring will have acquired the highest temperature it can attain, which is different at different points.
- When these temperatures are permanent, the source of heat supplies a quantity of heat exactly compensating for heat dissipated at all points of the external surface of the ring (conservation of energy)
- If at every point of the surface of the ring, while the temperatures are permanent and the source of heat remains, we raise an ordinate perpendicular to the plane of the ring (vector), whose length is proportional to the fixed temprature at that point, the curved line which passes thorugh the ends of these  coordinates will represent the permanent state of the temperatures.
- When the source is taken away, the problem becomes expressing, by one equation, the variable form of this curve as temperatures on every point begin decreasing. And thus including in a single formula all successive states of the solid.

Let $z$ be constant temperature at point $m$ of mean circmference.
$x$ distance of this point from source.
$m$ is point of mean circumference from source at point $o$.
$z$ highest temperature $m$ can attain and is a function of $x$.

When the source of heat is removed, denote by $t$ the time which has passed since the suppression of the source, and by $v$ the value of the temperature at point $m$ after $t$.
Quantity $v$ is function of $F(x, t)$, with initial value: $f(x) = F(x, O)$.

This is a first order differential equation.

Fourier states:

> The solution of these problems has made us understand that the effects of the propogation of heat depend in the case of every solid substance, on three elemntary qualities: capacity for heat, own conductivity, and exterior conductivity.

These are all represented using constants.
