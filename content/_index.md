I'm interested in how computers can work for **people**.
Finite-state analysis, modelling of phenomena, psychology experimentation, statistics and data analysis:

- **Interdisciplinary projects** with a computational component
- **Embedded devices**, sensors, and time-series data collection 
- **Website/web app development** for organizations and experiments
- **Human interface design** and UI implementation

Please reach out if you've landed here! Whether it's through a quick [chat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leozqi) or [email](mailto:leo@leozqi.com), I always enjoy meeting new people and am actively looking for projects where I can make an impact.
