# Instruction set architectures

A **instruction set architecture** (ISA) describes the functions of a processor.
It specifies:

- assembly instructions like `mov`, `ldr`, and `add`
- registers like `r0, lr, sp`
- _addressing modes_
    - register direct addressing
    - register indirect addressing
    - immediate data
    - pc-relative addressing
- _operating modes_ like privileged and unpriveleged execution
- _exception handling_

In this way, the ISA is a contract between chip architects and compiler designers.
A _microarchitecture_ is a hardware design that implements an ISA.
Instruction sets come in two forms, _reduced instruction_ and _complex instruction_ sets.

## Complex instruction sets

Complex instruction sets were popular until the 1980s.
They had features to make assembly programming easier:

1. Complex operations like (x86) `movsb` (copying a byte string in memory)
2. ALU operands can be specified directly from memory (as opposed to load-store architecture)
3. Complex addressing modes

They are distinguished by _variable instruction lengths_, _smaller executables_, but are very hard to **pipeline**.


## Reduced instruction sets

Reduced instruction sets are distinguished by their set of simple operations.

- ALU operands can only come from registers or constants (load-store architecture)
- Simple addressing modes (register-direct, register-indirect, immediate, and pc-relative)

Literature from the period emphasized the transition from code largely being written in hand-assembly, where complex instructions reduced development time and were easier to optimize, to high-level languages where a reduced instruction set was easier for compilers to use.[^PattersonDitzel]

RISC ISAs:

- have fixed instruction length
- produce slightly larger executables
- facilitates pipelining, which leads to more runtime optimization

A comparison: the RISC must load the memory into a register before performing any operations.

|CISC (M68000)|RISC (ARM)|
|---|---|
|`add d0, label`|`ldr r1,=label`|
|               |`ldr r2,[r1]`|
|               |`add r2,r0,r2`|
|               |`str r2,[r1]`|


# LEGv8

_LEGv8_ is a simplified version of the ARMv8 ISA.
Its instructions are all 32 bits wide.
Its registers each store 64 bits and are numbered from `x0 ... x31`.
Representative instructions include `add`, `ldr`, `str`, and `cbz`.

LEGv8 has three instruction formats or encodings:

- R-format (`add`): `<opcode 11> | <Rm 5> | <shamt 6> | <Rn 5> | <Rd 5>`
- D-format (`ldr1`): `<opcode 11> | <offset 9> | 00 | <Rn 5> | <Rt 5>`
- CB-format
