# Instruction set architectures

A **instruction set architecture** (ISA) describes the functions of a processor.
It specifies:

- assembly instructions like `mov`, `ldr`, and `add`
- registers like `r0, lr, sp`
- _addressing modes_
    - register direct addressing
    - register indirect addressing
    - immediate data
    - pc-relative addressing
- _operating modes_ like privileged and unpriveleged execution
- _exception handling_

In this way, the ISA is a contract between chip architects and compiler designers.
A _microarchitecture_ is a hardware design that implements an ISA.
Instruction sets come in two forms, _reduced instruction_ and _complex instruction_ sets.

## Complex instruction sets

Complex instruction sets were popular until the 1980s.
They had features to make assembly programming easier:

1. Complex operations like (x86) `movsb` (copying a byte string in memory)
2. ALU operands can be specified directly from memory (as opposed to load-store architecture)
3. Complex addressing modes

They are distinguished by _variable instruction lengths_, _smaller executables_, but are very hard to **pipeline**.


## Reduced instruction sets

Reduced instruction sets are distinguished by their set of simple operations.

- ALU operands can only come from registers or constants (load-store architecture)
- Simple addressing modes (register-direct, register-indirect, immediate, and pc-relative)

Literature from the period emphasized the transition from code largely being written in hand-assembly, where complex instructions reduced development time and were easier to optimize, to high-level languages where a reduced instruction set was easier for compilers to use.[^PattersonDitzel]

RISC ISAs:

- have fixed instruction length
- produce slightly larger executables
- facilitates pipelining, which leads to more runtime optimization

A comparison: the RISC must load the memory into a register before performing any operations.

|CISC (M68000)|RISC (ARM)|
|---|---|
|`add d0, label`|`ldr r1,=label`|
|               |`ldr r2,[r1]`|
|               |`add r2,r0,r2`|
|               |`str r2,[r1]`|


# LEGv8

_LEGv8_ is a simplified version of the ARMv8 ISA.
Its instructions are all 32 bits wide.
Its registers each store 64 bits and are numbered from `x0 ... x31`.
Representative instructions include `add`, `ldr`, `str`, and `cbz`.

LEGv8 has three instruction formats or encodings:

- R-format (`add`): `<opcode 11> | <Rm 5> | <shamt 6> | <Rn 5> | <Rd 5>`
- D-format (`ldr1`): `<opcode 11> | <offset 9> | 00 | <Rn 5> | <Rt 5>`
- CB-format

## Memory-mapped I/O

![LPC178x system diagram](/img/lpc178x-system-diagram.png)

The LPC1768 memory map is of the form

|Starting address (hex)|Description|
|---|---|
|`0000 0000`|Memory (flash, ram, rom)|
|`2000 0000`|I/O data|
||GPIO ports|
|`4000 0000`|APB (UART, CAN, WDT)|
||AHB (ENET, USB, DMA)|
|`6000 0000`|Unused|
|`E000 0000`|System services (interrupt controller, system tick)|


The _device bus interface_ is provided by any I/O device connected to the _microcontroller unit_ (MCU).
It consists of five elements:

1. _Address decoder_: recognizes addresses for its registers
2. _Bus logic_: combinational logic that responds to bus operations
3. _Control register(s)_: affect device behaviour
4. _Status register(s)_: describe device state
5. _Data register(s)_: pass data to and from the processor


## Polling I/O

When given a time-varying signal, we often need to sample the data at regular periods $T_0$.
Polling I/O accomplishes this by _polling_, or checking, the device status registers until it sees that the device is ready for an operation.
The steps are:

1. Read status register
2. Check "done" bit
3. If not set, goto (1)
4. Read and write to the data register
5. Process the data
6. Goto (1)


# Interrupts

## Vector table

The _vector table_ is a table in memory of handler addresses.

1. I/O device asserts its IRQ signal
2. Interrupt controller (IC) looks up the handler address in the vector table
3. IC invokes the handler
4. Handler runs (IRQ is dropped)
5. IC resumes the interrupted program
