# Terminology

An _abstract data type_ is a **type** described by the **collection of functions** on that type.
This can also be called an _abstraction_.

An _implementation_ is a concrete realization of an abstract data type or algorithm.

An _instance_ of a data type, or a particular list or tree, can be referred to as an _object_ or _version_.

A unique identity invariant under updates is a _persistent identity_.
Persistent data structures: when we speak of different versions of the same data structure, we mean that the different versions share a common persistent identity.

A _operation_ is a function
