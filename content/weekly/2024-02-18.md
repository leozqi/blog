Weekly update for 2024-02-24!
This will be my first update outlining objectives, things to do better, etc.

# Completed

1. Review and more pages for ECE222, ECE205, ECE204, ECE109, ECE240, ECE250, ECE205.
    Each of my 2A courses have now had their note created in my blog.
    I am aiming for quantitative understanding so in that respect they help a lot.


# Books read

- _Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager_ by James Stanier. A wonderful book on taking charge of your own progress and career and thinking about others, even if your final goal is not becoming an engineering manager.
- _A Mathematician's Apology_ by Godfrey Harold Hardy. Read because of the movie on Ramanujan. Interesting perspectives.


# Goals for next week

- Ace the midterms.
- Catch up on all practice assignments for the various courses.
