## Parallel-plate capacitor

$$C=\frac{\epsilon_0 A}s$$


A _capacitor_ stores energy.
How well it stores that energy is defined by its "capacitance."

$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V} \text{F}$$

> Can use $\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r A^{-1} V^{-1}$ to check.

{% definition(ref="Capacitance") %}
The amount of electric charge $Q$ required to increase the electric potential of a capacitor by $1\text{V}$.
{% end %}

When calculating capacitance, always choose electric potential difference from -ve to +ve.

$$\Delta V_{2\to 1} = -\int_2^1 \vec{E} dl, \vec{E}=E\cos\theta$$

Steps to solve:

1. Pick coordinate system, using either a line integral for parallel plates and rectangular systems and dr for spheres and cylinders.
2. Assign positive and negative charge to each capacitor plate considered. All excess charge exists on the surface/ exterior of the conductor.
3. Calculate potential difference from -Q to +Q (such that C>0), finding each electric field existing along the path.
4. C= Q/ \Delta V

The energy in a capacitor, or the work done to charge a capacitor, is given as:

$$w = \int dW = C\int udl - CV^2 \frac{1}2 = U_e = \frac{Q^2}{2C}$$
