A system that works well for me is to use **two** writing areas when organizing my train of thought.

- A **chronological tool** like a notebook where you write down what comes to you
- A **subject-based tool** that you can search for deeper, subject-based writing.

_Reasoning:_ Learning and thinking is a process.
Writing down your process in a chronological way helps you learn more effectively.
I find that I subconcisouly relate what I've written down and form "anchors" of understanding as I do this.
That is why I find having a chronological area so important: it ties down what I have been doing.

I also find mixing subjects to be useful in the chronological area.
I form connections as I jump from area to area.
It helps with memory and recalling the "why?" of some ideas.

The second area is the subject area.
This is where deep work occurs.
You group together relevant information from your chronological area, all on one subject, and relate it to other subjects.
I find a tool like Obsidian helps, but a notebook on each subject has also worked for me.
The chronological area helps with understanding, while the subject area helps as a reference for your memory when you already understand.

Link the two by referring to specific dates of your work in the subject area.
This way, you can easily look up dates where you made a discovery.
Likewise, you can review what you've learned in a period of time and search up deeper insights on your subject tool.

Most importantly, the method of taking the notes is not important.
What is important is that you _do_ take them, and as much as possible.
Then you will be able to recall more.
A secondary consideration is the longetivity, or if you will be able to access them in the future.
